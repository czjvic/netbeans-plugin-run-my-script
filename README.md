Run My Script Plugin
- Run currently opened file with an interpreter (useful for JavaScript file - you can run JavaScript file directly in NetBeans). Output will be inserted to Output window directly in Netbeans.
- Run your specific command with currently opened file in parameter. This is useful for ESLint or JSCS, which doesn't supported in netbeans... You can configure path to the ESLint/JSCS and in output window you will see result of the command.

Settings: Tools > Options > Miscellaneous > Run My Script
